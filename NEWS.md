# GenericML 0.1.1

- Fixed a few typos in the documentation.
- Added conditions so that learners based on the package `glmnet` in the tests and examples will be skipped on Solaris machines. Note that this does not prevent an error on Solaris because glmnet is still a `Suggest` of `GenericML` and `glmnet` v4.1.3 cannot be reliably installed on Solaris machines.

# GenericML 0.1.0

- Initial release on CRAN (Nov. 24, 2021)
