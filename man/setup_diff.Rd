\title{Setup function for \code{diff} arguments}
\usage{
setup_diff(subtract_from = "most", subtracted = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{subtract_from}{String indicating the base group to subtract from, either \code{"most"} (default) or \code{"least"}. The most affected group corresponds to the \eqn{K}-th group in the paper (there are \eqn{K} groups). The least affected group corresponds to the first group.}

\item{subtracted}{Vector indicating the groups to be subtracted from the group specified in \code{subtract_from}. If there are \eqn{K} groups, \code{subtracted} should be a subset of \eqn{{1,2,...,K}}. Be careful to not specify a zero difference: If \code{subtract_from = "most"}, subtracting group K results in a zero difference. Same if \code{subtract_from = "least"} and we subtract group 1.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{setup_diff}, consisting of the following components:
\describe{
\item{\code{subtract_from}}{A character equal to \code{"most"} or \code{"least"}.}
\item{\code{subtracted}}{A numeric vector of group indices.}
}
See the description above for details.
}
\description{
This setup function controls how differences of generic target parameters are taken. Returns a list with two components, called \code{subtract_from} and \code{subtracted}. The first element (\code{subtract_from}) denotes what shall be the base group to subtract from in the generic targets of interest (GATES or CLAN); either \code{"most"} or \code{"least"}. The second element (\code{subtracted}) are the groups to be subtracted from \code{subtract_from}, which is a subset of \eqn{{1,2,...,K}}, where \eqn{K} equals the number of groups. The number of groups should be consistent with the number of groups induced by the argument \code{quantile_cutoffs}, which is the cardinality of \code{quantile_cutoffs}, plus one.
}
\details{
The output of this setup function is intended to be used as argument in the functions \code{\link{GenericML}} and \code{\link{GenericML_single}} (arguments \code{diff_GATES}, \code{diff_CLAN}), as well as \code{\link{GATES}} and \code{\link{CLAN}} (argument \code{diff}).
}
\examples{
## specify quantile cutoffs (the 4 quartile groups here)
quantile_cutoffs <- c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)

## Use group difference GK-G1 as generic targets in GATES and CLAN
## Gx is the x-th group
setup_diff(subtract_from = "most", subtracted = 1)

## Use GK-G1, GK-G2, GK-G3 as differenced generic targets
setup_diff(subtract_from = "most", subtracted = c(1,2,3))

## Use G1-G2, G1-G3 as differenced generic targets
setup_diff(subtract_from = "least", subtracted = c(3,2))
